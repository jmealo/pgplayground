The Era of the Great Wars: Nationalism, imperialism, industrialization, and militarism contributed to an increase in economic and military competition among European nations, the Ottoman Empire, and Japan, and led to World War I. The failure of the Treaty of Versailles, the impact of the global depression, and the expansionist policies and actions of Axis nations are viewed as major factors that resulted in World War II. World Wars I and II were "total wars" in which nations mobilized entire populations and economies and employed new military tactics that resulted in unprecedented death and destruction, as well as drastic changes in political boundaries. World Wars I and II challenged economic and political power structures and gave rise to a new balance of power in the world. Economic, technological, and military power and bureaucracies have been used by nations to deliberately and systematically destroy ethnic/racial, political, and cultural groups.
