Apply properties of operations to calculate with numbers in any form; convert between forms as appropriate; and assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and  estimation strategies. For example: If a woman making $25 an hour gets a 10% raise,  she will make an additional 1/10 of her  salary an hour,  or $2.50, for a new salary of $27.50. If you want to place a towel bar  9 3/4 inches long in the center of a door that is 27 1/2 inches wide, you will need to place the bar about 9 inches from each edge; this estimate can be used as a check on  the exact computation."
